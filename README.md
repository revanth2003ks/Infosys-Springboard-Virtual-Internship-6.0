# Infosys-Springboard-Virtual-Internship-6.0

### 📌 Day 1 | Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship 6.0

On Day 1 of my Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship 6.0, I learned the fundamentals of GitHub and how it is used for hosting, managing, and collaborating on projects.

🔹 Key GitHub Learnings:

✔ How to create and manage a GitHub repository
✔ Importance of writing a clear README.md to explain project purpose and usage
✔ Adding a LICENSE to define how others can use the project
✔ Using .gitignore to avoid pushing unnecessary or sensitive files
✔ Understanding GitHub remotes and how local repositories connect to GitHub

🔹 GitHub-Related Commands Practiced:

git remote – view connected remote repositories

git remote add origin <repo_url> – connect local project to GitHub

git push -u origin --all – push all branches to GitHub

git pull – fetch and merge updates from GitHub

git fetch – fetch updates without merging

git branch – view and manage branches

This session helped me understand how GitHub supports collaboration, version control, and project visibility, which is crucial for real-world development and data projects.
